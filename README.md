# music-genres-classifier

This is a convolutional neural network project by Bilal Soukouna and Peter Wu to classify the genres of 30-second snippets of music based on their spectrograms. All the data we work with is from the GTZAN Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

The original project was written on Jupyter notebook but for memory purposes I have adapted it to Google Colab.
